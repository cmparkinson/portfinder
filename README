Introduction:
-------------
	The is a small Java application designed to facilitate the tracing of
	ethernet cables from wall jacks to their connected switch ports.  The
	application relies on switches generating SNMP traps, then sending them to
	the server component of the application whenever a new MAC address is
	detected on a port.
		
	The client portion of the application creates an ethernet frame with a
	custom MAC address.  The MAC address has a room number and jack index
	(both values are configurable through the client GUI) encoded in it.
	The switch detects the new MAC address, generates a trap and sends it to
	the server portion of the application.  The server captures the trap and
	stores the information in a database.  The trap information contains
	everything necessary to determine which switch port that generated the
	trap.     

	So far the application has only been tested on OSX with Cisco switches,
	however it should run with only minor modifications on Linux and with other
	switch vendors.
