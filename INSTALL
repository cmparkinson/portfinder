Switches:
---------
	The switches will need to be configured to send SNMPv1 traps to the IP and
	UDP port that the server is listening on.

MySQL:
------
	Import the schema file.

Client:
-------
	The libethernet C library used for low-level communication with the BSD
	network layer needs to be compiled.  Change to the libethernet directory
	and execute 'make'.  The compiled library will be named 'libethernet.dylib'
	and must be copied to the directory that the client jar will be run out of.

	Change to the portfinder-client directory and execute 'mvn package'.  The
	'portfinder-client-1.0.jar' file and lib/ directory located under the target
	directory will contain the necessary files to start the application.  Make
	sure the 'libethernet.dylib' file created above is in the same directory as
	'portfinder-client-1.0.jar'.
	
	Start the client by executing: 'java -jar portfinder-client-1.0.jar'
	
Server:
-------
	Change to the portfinder-server directory and execute 'mvn package'.  The
	'portfinder-server-1.0.jar' file and lib/ directory located under the target
	directory will contain the necessary files to start the application.
	
	Database connection information and the UDP port to listen on must be passed
	on the command line.  The order of the command line arguments is:
	<database host> <database name> <database user> <database password> <udp port>
	
	Start the server by executing:
	'java -jar portfinder-server-1.0.jar <dbhost> <dbname> <dbuser> <dbpass> <port>'
